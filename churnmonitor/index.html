            <p>This webpage displays IP churn events measured from Mirai infections between April 17, and August 20, 2024. The data includes changes in IP addresses observed during this period and visualizes them as Cumulative Distribution Functions (CDFs) based on the duration of the events.</p>
            <p><strong>How to Interpret the Graph:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The graph shows the duration of each session before an IP change, measured from infected devices.</li>
                <li>Not every part of a network will experience churn, so you might see outliers in the graph. These outliers can occur in subnets where the infection did not cause significant churn.</li>
                <li>When a large portion of the network experiences churn, the graph will typically show a sharp increase near the churn event time. A good example is Deutsche Telekom AG, with an estimated churn time of 86.000 seconds (24 hours).</li>
            </ul>
