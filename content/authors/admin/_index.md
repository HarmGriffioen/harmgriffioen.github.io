I am an assistant professor at the cyber security group at Delft University of Technology. My research interests include internet measurements, network security, and cyber threat intelligence. During my PhD I studied for two years at the Hasso Plattner Institute in Potsdam, Germany, and finished the PhD at Delft University of Technology. If you are interested in internet wide measurements and want to collaborate, you can reach me at: h.j.griffioen AT tudelft DOT nl.
