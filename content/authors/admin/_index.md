I am an assistant professor at the cyber security group at Delft University of Technology. My research interests include internet measurements, network security, and cyber threat intelligence. During my PhD I studied for two years at the Hasso Plattner Institute in Potsdam, Germany, and finished the PhD at Delft University of Technology. If you are interested in Internet-wide measurements and want to collaborate, you can reach me at: h.j.griffioen AT tudelft DOT nl.
