abstract = {Using hundreds of thousands of compromised IoT devices, the Mirai botnet emerged in late 2016 as a game changing threat actor, capable of temporarily taking down major Internet service providers and Internet infrastructure. Since then, dozens of variants of IoT-based botnets have sprung up, and in today's Internet distributed denial-of-service attacks from IoT devices have become a major attack vector. This proliferation was significantly driven by the public distribution of the Mirai source code, which other actors used to create their own, customized version of the original Mirai botnet. In this paper we provide a comprehensive view into the ongoing battle over the Internet of Things fought by Mirai and its many siblings. Using 7,500 IoT honeypots, we show that we can use 300,000,000 compromisation attempts from infected IoT devices as well as a design flaw in Mirai's random number generator to obtain insights into Mirai infections worldwide. We find that networks and the particular malware strains that plague them are tightly connected, and malware authors over time take over strategies from their competitors. The most surprising finding is that epidemiologically, IoT botnets are not self-sustaining: were it not for continuous pushes from bootstrapping, Mirai and its variants would die out.},
