abstract = {Unsolicited traffic sent to advertised network space that does not host active services provides insights about misconfigurations as well as potentially malicious activities, including the spread of Botnets, DDoS campaigns, and exploitation of vulnerabilities. Network telescopes have been used for many years to monitor such unsolicited traffic. Unfortunately, they are limi the available address space for such tasks and, thus, limited to specific geographic and/or network regions.In this paper, we introduce a novel concept to broadly capture unsolicited Internet traffic, which we call a "meta-telescope". A meta-telescope is based on the intuition that, with the availability of appropriate vantage points, one can (i) infer which address blocks on the Internet are unused and (ii) capture traffic towards them-both without having control of such address blocks. From this intuition, we develop and evaluate a methodology for identifying unlikely to be used Internet address space and build a meta-telescope that has very desirable properties, such as broad coverage of dark space both in terms of size and topological placement. Such meta-telescope identifies and captures unsolicited traffic to more than 350k /24 blocks in more than 7k ASes. Through the analysis of background radiation towards these networks, we also highlight that unsolicited traffic differs by destination network/geographic region as well as by network type. Finally, we discuss our experience and challenges when operating a meta-telescope in the wild.},
